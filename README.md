The full reveal.js documentation is available at [revealjs.com](https://revealjs.com/).



## Setup

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (10.0.0 or later)

2. Clone the reveal.js repository

   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git
   ```

3. Move to the reveal.js folder and install dependencies

   ```shell
   $ cd reveal.js && npm install
   ```

4. Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes

   ```shell
   $ npm start
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) to view your presentation

## Outline

- What is Hardware Development, why it is so important
- How to develop any prototype
  - A brief IDEA about any non-pure-software stuff
  - Split the function to a few small function
  - Decide use which model to achieve each function
  - Buy lots of stuff from taobao, JLC
- A list of what we need to learn(incomplete)
- A brief introduction to: 
  1. Dev boards such as Arduino and STM32; 
  2. Communication protocol such as UART, SPI, I2C and RS232; 
  3. Programming languages including C, Python, java, C++, Verilog; 
  4. Debug tools such as olliscope, waveform generator, multimeter; 
  5. Perphriels(外设) like brushless motor, servo motor, stepper motor, microphone, IMU, display; 
  6. Circuits simulate and PCB design tools: Multisim, Kicad, Altium Designer; 
  7. Soldering and SMT: QFNP, QFP, BGA, DIP......JLC
  8. Algorithms: FFT, PID
  9. HCI design
  10. Shape(shell) design
- Discussion about the future of hardware engineering.
